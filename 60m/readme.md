 - go tool trace
   - seeing the CPU scheduler in action, fixing with https://github.com/uber-go/automaxprocs
   - TCP dials are globally pooled: one misbehaving network configuration will impact other areas
   - the trace viewer is old, recycled from chromium, and they've been actively looking to replace it for a while
 - [pcabinet](https://github.com/raidancampbell/pcabinet)
 - making your own profiles
 - custom tracing:
   - tasks are inter-goroutine units of work (similar to a `transaction` in sentry)
   - regions provide a label to callstacks within a single goroutine (similar to a `span` in sentry)
   - if a trace captures multiple tasks or regions, they are coalesced by callstacks not by their label
   - logs may be emitted with custom key/value pairs and are tagged to a task
 - demo a CPU profile
 - demo a memory profile
 - demo a trace
 - `pprof` is vendored into `go tool` for convenience, but has its own lifecycle
 - disassembled instructions aren't 100% accurate due to [nondeterministic "skid"](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/41338) when correlating the program counter to the assembly.
   - why are duplicate instructions returned during disassembly?
   - this appears to only be a thing for `weblist`: `disasm` does not have the duplicates
   - this really feels like a bug.  commented [here](https://github.com/google/pprof/pull/628#discussion_r1155236412) on it.
